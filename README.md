# speechDenoiserToWav
This project implements a 1D Convolutional U-Net as a neural audio denoiser to improve automatic speech recognition (ASR) performance. The model operates directly on raw waveforms, learns to remove background noise, and outputs a cleaned audio signal that is then fed into OpenAI’s Whisper-small model.
